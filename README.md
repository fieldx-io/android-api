#### Integrate FieldX in Your Android app


#### Setup FieldX Integration Permissions

FieldX System allows only approved Apps to connect to FieldX Client. In order to allow your app to communicate with FieldX,

- Login into the Web Portal (https://fieldx.io)
- Navigate to Global Config and Search for "Whitelisted Apps for API Access".
- Add package name of the app that should be allowed to access FieldX APIs.
- The permission might take 15-30 minutes to get applied. During Development stage, you might want to open the `Manager` app and click on `Sync Policies` for quick sync.

#### App to App Integration

* The Demo app is provided as a reference on how to use the APIs
* The Demo app has a copy of FieldX API AAR file.
* To use latest copy of AAR file, refer GitHub Packages for the Repository. (right bottom corner of this page)
